# ElyEco

This is a small personal Minecraft plugin project.

The project exists mainly for **learning and experimentation**.  
I am transitioning from **Java to Kotlin**, so the codebase is intentionally mixed and not always clean or optimal.

Do not expect:
- perfect architecture
- stable APIs
- clean abstractions
- production-ready quality

Some parts are written in Java, some in Kotlin, and some decisions are made purely for learning purposes.

Nothing here is meant to be “best practice”.  
It is mostly a sandbox for testing ideas and getting comfortable with Kotlin on the JVM.
